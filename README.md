# Stats220

## My repro for STATS220
**I am writing this Repository for the purpose of my project 1.**

*Hello everyone, this repository would be a public repository made from me for the purposes of* :
1. Showing how meme images are made by R programs. 
2. Reflecting on the materials that I have learnt from this course. 

Hopefully from my work you would
* gain knowlege 
* inspiration 
* see the fun behind R code

This will be a link to the markdown file of the meme I made on R which is on [Github]().
